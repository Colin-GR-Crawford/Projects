# Projects
Below is a list of projects I have completed since November 2016. A number of these projects were part of a course I completed (Oct-Jan), the remaining are personal projects used to expand my domain knowledge. Please see brackets at the end of each description for key tools used.

### [Mens Shoes - Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/Colin-GR-Crawford/Projects/tree/master/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks%20-%20Image%20Classification)
This is the first part of a larger overall project looking at men’s shoes. This section was completed in co-orporation with a friend www.github.com/jaycribb . In these notebooks we use CNN’s to attempt to classify shoes using the database of images I collected in the first part. I also compare the results of the classification against that of the SIFT/SVM method used previously. This work is currently a work in progress. For these models we used Amazon EC2 instances as the dataset the model complexity increased substantially.
**[Keras (Tensorflow backend), AWS EC2, OpenCV, PIL, Classification, CNNs]**

### [Mens Shoes - Image Recognition](https://github.com/Colin-GR-Crawford/Projects/tree/master/Mens_Shoes_Image_Recognition)
This is the first part of a larger overall project looking at men’s shoes. Using images scraped from retailer websites, I perform some EDA on dominant colours using clustering, I then use some older computer vision methods  - SIFT in combination with spatial pyramid matching to attempt to find the closest matching shoe to a input image from the dataset.
**[Clustering, Computer Vision, Scale Invariant Feature Transformation, Spatial Pyramid Matching, OpenCV]**

### [Mens Shoes - Price Prediction](https://github.com/Colin-GR-Crawford/Projects/tree/master/Mens_Shoes_Price_Prediction)
This is the first part of a larger overall project looking at men’s shoes. In this folder, I scrape data on men’s shoes from 6 prominent retailer websites. I proceed to clean the data and perform some EDA finally creating a reasonably strong model to predict prices for a pair of shoes given the brand and description.
**[BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Classification, NLP]**

### [Data Science Wages Classification](https://github.com/Colin-GR-Crawford/Projects/tree/master/Data_Science_Wages)
In this project I create a model to classify Data Science job wage bands in the US based upon key descriptive and location data within the job advertisement.
**[BeautifulSoup, Classification]**

### [IMDB Movie Ratings Prediction](https://github.com/Colin-GR-Crawford/Projects/tree/master/IMDB_Movie_Ratings)
Using an IMDB API and scraped inforamtion, I predict movie ratings from movie attribute data ie. Country, Genre, Cast members etc.
**[BeautifulSoup, APIs, Regression]**

### [Iris Clustering and Digit Classification](https://github.com/Colin-GR-Crawford/Projects/tree/master/Iris_clustering_and_digit_classification)
A brief example of using hierarchal clustering for the iris dataset and some classification models for to classifiy some images of hand-written digits.
**[Clustering, Classification]**

### [Iowa Alcahol Sales](https://github.com/Colin-GR-Crawford/Projects/tree/master/Iowa_Alcahol_Sales)
In this project I used a dataset from the Iowa state website to try and predict the ideal location for a new store to be located.
**[Regression, Tableau]**

### [Titanic Survival](https://github.com/Colin-GR-Crawford/Projects/tree/master/Titanic_Survival)
This is one of the first projects I completed using classification models. This uses the well-known titanic dataset and attempts to predict who will survive based on attributes such as age, sex class etc. Based on a kaggle competition.
**[Classification]**

### [A/B Testing with Pymc]()
This is a brief look at using Pymc3 to do some AB testing on two different datasets, one looks at 5 different options for a University Library homage layout, the other is comparing death rates in the US between men and women.
