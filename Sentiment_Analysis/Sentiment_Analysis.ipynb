    "## Sentiment Analysis using Bernoulli NB\n",
    "In this notebook a series of sentiment analysis models are created and packaged into a pickle file. The models are created using a bernoulii distribution niave-bayes model as it is very efficent and generally performs quite well with text classification. The classifications have been created manually are are related to themes within the input comments ie. Capacity - A comment where a respondant is stating there is not enough capacity on the service. Each class has its own model, the entire dataset is iterated for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of postive classes is quite small in comparison to the size of the entire dataset, SMOTE resampling has been used to ensure that the models are robust. SMOTE resamples the training data, so that there is a specified proportion of positive classifications as negative, this means that the model is less likely to automatically consider each result postitive (or negative) which would result in a very high accuracy, but low recall and precision metrics.\n",
    "Once the models have been created they are packaged into a pickle file which can be extracted and run on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting model will be used as the first stage in processing public consultation responses, the model will highlight themes mentioned in the commments, however it is expected that a user will go over each of the results and correct the themes and add further comments as necessary. Because of this second stage of the process it is not necessary that this model be optimised fully as this would be quite time consuming. Therefore a base model will be made where each classification result has a score of at least 50% (Recall)."

    "### Accuracy\n",
    "As discussed in the introduction, the number of positive classifications in the data set (for each class) is a very small proportion of the dataset as a whole. Therefore using a metric such as accuracy will not give a good view of whether the model is performangin well or not. The base case (applying negitive/0 to all inputs) would result in an accuracy of above 95% in most cases, therefore it is dificult to build the model around this. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Precision vs Recall\n",
    "As this model will be used as the first step in a process, and a user will be evaulating each result, it is better for the model to 'overpredict' then 'underpredict' as it is easier for a user to to remove wrong selections then add the correct ones. Based on this principle the driving metric will be Recall, however I will ensure that precision is not so low that the model is just churning out all positive results.\n"

The recall results are also acceptable for most of the models, however there are certain cases where this is coupled with a very low precision score. For the cases with either a low Recall score or a very low Preicison score the models will be rerun with a modified SMOTE ratio. This will ensure when the model is fitting that the base accuracy recall and preicison are a lot lower, leading to a hopefully more accurate model."
